This repository containes the code for a nice and fun browser game, entirely written in javascript.
It will have nice sprites, animations and even simple physics.

## State of the game
<span style="color:#FF5733">**PRE-ALPHA**</span>

Currently there is now playable version of the game.
You can open it and maybe move things around but there is no actual game right now.

The next state will be the **ALPHA** state. Here you can expect basic gameplay (limited to core principles and with lots of bugs) for the first time.
You can expect this happen in late february 2023. Stay tuned!

### Detailed list of features in current state
- Fantasy themed background (magic forrest sprite)
- a player placeholder circle spawning in the middle of the map
- random obstacles (also placeholder circles)
- player can move with the mouse by clicking on the map or holding the mouse button down
- a simple line is showing the direction the player is moving
- obstacle placing follows simple rules to always match the game area and let enough space for the player to move around them
